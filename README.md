UoA CS373 Lab Solutions for 2020 S1.

Computer Science 373 - Computer Graphics and Image Proccessing.

This repository houses my lab solutions for the CS373 course for the 2020 Semester 1 term.
These solutions cover topics from week 1-12 (labs 1-9) ranging from the following topics:
Basic Geometry 
Graphics + OpenGL
Light and Illumination
Shading and Shadows
3D Modelling and Transformations
Texture Mapping
Raytracing
Parametric Curves and Surfaces
Digital Images and Histograms, Global Intensity Transformations, Histogram Equalization
Filtering, Edge Detection, Segmentation
Mathetmatical Morphology, Morphological Image Processing, Region-based Segmentation, Connected Component Labelling

The Computer Graphics component of the course was tackled using C++ solutions, whereas the latter Image Processing portion contained Python problems and solutions.
